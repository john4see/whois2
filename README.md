# Using the Whois API 2.0 web service

[Whois API](https://whoisapi.whoisxmlapi.com) provides domain
names'/IP addresses' well-parsed and accurate registration
details—also known as Whois Records—such as registrant names, emails,
addresses, registrar info, creation/expiration dates etc. for most of the
gTLDs and ccTLDs.

Here you'll find examples of querying the API implemented in multiple
languages.

You'll need a
[WhoisXmlApi account](https://whoisapi.whoisxmlapi.com/signup) to
authenticate.

Please, refer to the
[Whois API documentation](https://whoisapi.whoisxmlapi.com/docs) for info on
input parameters, request/response formats, authentication instructions and
more.
